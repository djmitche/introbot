h1. Introbot

The idea here is to take "lalita":https://launchpad.net/lalita/ , which is already an easy-to-use irc bot, and make it easy for someone completely new to programming to write an IRC bot.

h2. Getting started

* download this project (use the "Download Source" button up top in github) and untar or unzip it
* optional: this gets you a "sandboxed" python install, so you can install whatever other stuff you need
** download "virtualenv":http://bitbucket.org/ianb/virtualenv/raw/e771e026dff3/virtualenv.py
** run @virtualenv.py sandbox@
** run @source sandbox/bin/activate@
* run @python setup.py develop@
* run @introbot channelname@.  Your bot will appear in #channelname on freenode.
* you can ping the bot in IRC with something like "dustinbot: ping"

h2. Hacking

* open @introbot/actions.py@ and edit it.  Don't look at the other files - they are not introductory-level.
* to run your bot without an IRC server, run @textbot@ instead.

h2. Suggestions

* Use 'if' statemnts to respond to some commands like "dance" or "yo mamma"
** use string operations to break commands apart: @split@ or @startswith@
* Use the "random.choice":http://docs.python.org/library/random.html#random.choice function to choose a random quote on request
* Use a dictionary to give answers to questions posed in IRC
* Reply to everything in ROT13
