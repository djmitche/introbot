h1. Introbot

The idea here is to take lalita (https://launchpad.net/lalita/), which is
already an easy-to-use irc bot, and make it easy for someone completely new
to programming to write an IRC bot.

h2. Getting started

* download this project and untar/unzip it
* download virtualenv (http://bitbucket.org/ianb/virtualenv/raw/e771e026dff3/virtualenv.py)
* run @virtualenv.py sandbox@
* run @source sandbox/bin/activate@
** this gets you a "sandboxed" python install, so you can install whatever other stuff you need
* run @python setup.py develop@
* run @infobot #channelname@.  Your bot will appear in #channelname on freenode.
* you can ping the bot in IRC with something like "dustinbot: ping"
